## Introduction

This project aims to simplify bank data used by developers for Fintech APIs (Flutterwave and Paystack). Paystack uses `bank_code` to process transfers to accounts while Flutterwave uses `bank_slug` for the same operation. As a bonus, bank logos are also returned. How is this useful? -- can be used to spice up your bank dropdown/list UI, It doesn't have to be boring.
